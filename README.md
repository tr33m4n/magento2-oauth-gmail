# magento2-oauth-gmail
A simple way to send mail via Gmail using Oauth

## This is alpha software!
This module allows Magento to send emails through a Gmail account using Oauth credentials, rather than having to create/manage a real email account purely for the website to use Gmail's SMTP.

## Installing
This module is available on https://packagist.org/
```sh
composer require tr33m4n/magento2-oauth-gmail
